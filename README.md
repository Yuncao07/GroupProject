In the controller, "room-info-by-room number", all room numbers are displayed and they are all clickable. When a room number is clicked, the corresponding view shows information of the selected room including room number, price and periods of valid reservations of this room (e.g. 11/28/18-11/30/18, 12/25/18-12/26/18).
